  title: Structured Narrative Processing and Generation
  people: Patty Delafuente, Marcus McAllister
  img:
  about: Although I have worked on <a href="https://repository.gatech.edu/entities/publication/cdc9c234-f370-4d46-9ba5-a651dba37935" aria-label="Lara's thesis on Neurosymbolic automated story generation">neurosymbolic automated story generation</a> for a while, I believe neurosymbolic techniques are becoming even more important in today's era of large language modeling. Symbolic techniques are older AI techniques that often involve a significant amount of hand engineering but can result in predictable & interpretable output and behavior. These can range from rule-based systems to planners. Neurosymbolic storytelling enables systems to have the flexibility and broad range of output that LLMs can generate while maintaining important storytelling components such as plot, coherency, and consistency. We are also looking at the application of narrative communication within robotics and detecting inconsistencies in data.

  title: AI Agents for Playing Dungeons and Dragons
  people: Patty Delafuente, Arya Honraopatil

  about: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons" aria-label="wikipedia page for dungeons and dragons">Dungeons & Dragons (D&D)</a> is a tabletop roleplaying game originally created in the 1970s. Now that we've seen AI that can play games like <a href="http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature16961">Go</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06680">DotA 2</a>, or <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097">Diplomacy</a>, I believe D&D is the next big challenge in AI. The game lends itself to a <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2321/paper4.pdf">variety of interesting problems</a> where players have to use skills in Theory of Mind and improvisational storytelling, all while following the rules of the game.

  title: Community-Sensitive NLP Tools for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)
  people: 
  about: <a href="https://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/aac/" aria-label="the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's explanation of AAC">Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)</a> tools have been largely ignored by the natural language processing community. However, even though it has been an exciting time in NLP, we must implement such tools with caution &ndash; taking into consideration what AAC users actually want. I am interested in improving AAC by bringing their technology to the era of ChatGPT without sacrificing users' autonomy, privacy, or personality.

  title: Customizable and Emotive Speech Synthesis
  people: Arya Honraopatil, Sai Vallurupalli
  img:
  about: Now that transformer models have greatly improved speech synthesis (also called text-to-speech/TTS) capabilities, I believe the next step is to make voices that can emulate the rich tapestry of people's voice qualities.
